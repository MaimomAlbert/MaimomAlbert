### Snapshot
- 🔬 Focus: Feature engineering, model deployment, MLOps, A/B testing, and explainability  
- ⚙️ Tech: Python · Pandas · NumPy · scikit-learn · TensorFlow/PyTorch · SQL · Airflow · Docker · Kubernetes · MLflow · AWS/GCP  
- 📈 Impact: Built production models that improved X metric by Y% and generated $Z in ARR (replace with your metrics)

---

### Featured Projects
- **[ProjectName-1](https://github.com/your/repo1)** — End-to-end recommender: offline pipeline, model training, A/B rollout, +10% engagement. (Python, TensorFlow, Docker)  
- **[ProjectName-2](https://github.com/your/repo2)** — Time-series forecasting for demand planning with automated retraining and monitoring. (Prophet/TF, Airflow)  
- **[ProjectName-3](https://github.com/your/repo3)** — Interactive dashboard and model explainability notebooks demonstrating SHAP and counterfactuals. (Streamlit, SHAP)

### How I work
1. Define product metric & success criteria (KPIs)  
2. Build reproducible pipeline (data tests, feature store, experiment tracking)  
3. Deploy via container/K8s + automated retrain & monitoring  
4. Measure impact and iterate

### Sample notebooks & demos
- Colab / Binder links for notebooks: add links here for easy recruiter demos

---

### Open to
- Full-time Data Scientist / ML Engineer roles  
- Collaborations on production ML systems or data platform improvements
